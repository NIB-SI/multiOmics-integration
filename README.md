## Expected measurements

Factorial experiment:

- one or multiple genotypes AND/OR
- under single and multiple abiotic/biotic stressors AND/OR
- experiment duration: hours, days, ... : time-series experimental design AND/OR
- tissue: single or multiple

- Omics' strategies: 
  * Hormonomics
  * Transcriptomics 
  * Proteomics
  * Metabolomics 
  * Phenomics
  * ...

- Combination of targeted and untargeted measurements
- Phenomics data should be preprocessed, i.e. this protocol does not include image analysis

## Analysis
Protocol for the integration of multi-omics data and deep phenotyping of potato cv. Désirée under single- and combined abiotic stress responses is available at [_p_ADAPTOmics](https://github.com/NIB-SI/multiOmics-integration/tree/main/_p_ADAPTOmics)
