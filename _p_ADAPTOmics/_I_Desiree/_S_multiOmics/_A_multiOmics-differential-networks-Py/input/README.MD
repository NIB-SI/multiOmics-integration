# Input for assay `_A_015_thresholding-py`

`input/biochem-net-basis.cys` - contains a Cytoscape session of the knowledge network (defined in `node-annotations.tsv` and `KnowledgeNetwork-biochem.tsv`). See `scripts/3-threshold-graphs-diff-graphs.ipynb` for how it was created. This is used as the basis for the network visualisation, and the layout and style was manually done.
